Why open machine learning
==========================

Open machine learning is close to open source but since openness requires more than open source software alone we use the term open machine learning. The term open source (OSS) means FOSS in this publication. This because the Freedom part makes a great difference in making sure machine learning technology and all other aspects involved really preserver freedom in a sustainable way.


FOSS machine learning is crucial for all. In our view machine learning technology must be inclusive for all. This means that besides using OSS machine learning frameworks like Tensorflow more aspects must be open. This to achieve that machine learning becomes a real open and inclusive technology that can be used for the advantage of everyone. 

Free and Open machine learning means that everyone should be able to develop, test and play and deploy machine learning based solutions. So inclusive. Large investments should not be needed for using and applying machine learning. So not only companies or people who can afford the enormous investments needed in specialized GPU hardware should benefit of machine learning but everyone should be able to create meaningful applications to create a better world.

The following aspects are needed for Free and Open Machine Learning:

- FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)
- Open data
- Open algorithms (machine learning libraries)
- Open architectures
- Open Science 




Open Source (FOSS) 
-------------------

Free and open-source software (FOSS) is software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software. FOSS is an inclusive term that covers both free software(FLOSS) and open-source software(OSS).

Open Source is an approach for the design, development, and distribution of new products & knowledge offering practical accessibility to its source. Real open source solutions have a license that is approved by the FSF.org or the OSI foundation. Open source is all about collaboration. Collaboration is key for developing, applying and using machine learning functionality. 

Open Source Software(OSS) is the norm for machine learning. However using open source software will still be new and innovative for a lot of companies. However if you want really want to benefit from using machine learning software you must go for a solid OSS machine learning ecosystem. This makes you flexible, independent and you can still use thousands of consultancy firms and hosting companies that can help you. 

A transition towards OSS can already be very hard and can be disruptive. And applying machine learning for real business cases is also already complex and challenging. But using machine learning without taken direct benefit from the OSS ecosystems that come with is like learning to swim without hitting the water. So hit the water as soon as possible, after a while you will see the benefits.

Machine learning applications are expensive to develop and to adopt. This accounts for the development process itself, but even more for the needed infrastructure and resources to develop meaningful applications for your business. This means that currently big firms like Google, IBM, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon are at the front of the queue and smaller counterparts get left behind. Since most of the scientific knowledge is freely available and more and more infrastructure needed is available within the open source domain, this book is entirely focussed on open source. The technique behind machine learning is too much fun and often requires adjustments and tweaking, which is hard when you are using black-box solutions. 

OSS developments in the machine learning field are no hobby projects. Almost all major OSS machine learning developments are backed by small or large companies(e.g. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Uber) active in the deep learning ecosystem. Small machine learning OSS projects are often developed by researchers from backed by a strong foundation  or by universities.

A focus on OSS for applying machine learning for real is crucial. OSS machine learning applications and frameworks have the following benefits:

- Create solutions software faster, better and with less friction. You can adjust what you want without limitations.
- Lower cost for creating your first pilot project. Mind: Your first attempts will fail. And the faster your pilot projects fail, the better. This since applying the new machine learning capabilities requires some learning curve. Technical, but even more on the organization and business side.
- Flexibility and changeability.
- No vendor lock ins. Of course the machine learning cloud offerings of the major tech companies are great (Azure ML, IBM Watson, Amazon, Google etc). But playing around without any strings attached and limitations set for you gives you a head start.

Almost all companies advertise with machine learning powered software products nowadays. This also means that all existing software that is already been sold for decades is now suddenly re-branded with the new machine learning buzz words. Like cognitive, artificial intelligence (AI) powered and data driven. You can easily be fooled since massive marketing effort (time, money, material) has been invested to sell the old buggy solutions as new innovative machine learning powered solutions. In reality black box solutions from small or large vendors are almost always based on fads.  This is why you should be very suspicious when using cloud based machine offerings without an option to DIY. So if the new solution looks to good to be true, be aware. When using machine learning OSS solutions you can inspect yourself the working or ask someone to audit the software you directly know what the promise is based on. Because in the end: The security, safety and privacy of your customers are at risk.


Open data
----------

For Free and Open machine learning we do not only need FOSS software, but also open data sets. Data is one of the most important aspects for making machine learning work. Without data and open transparent insights in the various quality aspects of the data machine learning is not open.

Trust in the outcome of applications powered by machine learning technology is only possible when the input data is fully available.

Open and reusable quality datasets are crucial for creating machine learning driven applications. 

Creating a data set to test and develop machine learning algorithms is hard and time consuming. many current machine learning algorithms are developed and proven by using open data sets. 
In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research a short overview can be found of various data sets used for scientific machine learning research.

Free and open machine learning means that everyone should be able to access and use data used. So Google, Facebook and many other companies who donate a lot of machine learning knowledge and frameworks in the open source domain rarely release datasets that are used for their fantastic commercial machine learning offerings. Not knowing details about datasets, especially for live saving systems that are powered using machine learning technology, means verification of claims is impossible. 

Open Science
-------------

Machine learning is a challenging science. Many researchers on universities worldwide are working to develop new knowledge for solving a range of complex problems.

Universities are funded by tax payers. So in an ideal world everyone should benefit from knowlegde developed. Also almost all knowledge developed is based on work developed of others. This is how science works. 

Open science represents an approach to the scientific process based on cooperative work and new ways of diffusing knowledge by using digital technologies and new collaborative tools. The idea captures a systemic change to the way science and research have been carried out for the last fifty years: shifting from the standard practices of publishing research results in scientific publications towards sharing and using all available knowledge at an earlier stage in the research process.

Developing machine learning knowledge using open science means that publications, data, results, and software is accessible without borders for everyone to learn and build upon. Key pillars of open science important for open machine learning are:

- Open Data
- Open source
- Open access

Only in this way trust in new machine learning algorithms, frameworks and trained data sets can be reached.




Open architectures

Green ML
----------

Applying new technology brings new responsibilities. 
Computations power needed for  deep learning  research  have  been  doubling  every  few  months. Machine learning computations have a very  large carbon footprint. Ironically, deep learning was inspired by the human brain, which is remarkably energy efficient. Moreover, the financial cost of the computations can make it difficult for academics, students, and researchers, in particular those from emerging economies, to engage in deep learning research.

Green ML means is machine learning optimized to minimize resource utilization and environmental impact. This can be done by data center resource optimization, balancing training data requirements versus accuracy, choosing less resource intense models or in some cases transfer learning versus new models. 


Besides the cost green machine learning is a important factor for Free and Open machine learning since the benefits machine learning can bring should not harm the environment of all living cells that have no direct relationship with your machine learning application. The Freedom to use this powerfull technology should not limit the freedom to live in good health of others. So green ML is a difficult but important aspects for machine learning developments. So chose algoritmes that perform well without weeks of calculation on datasets. Or make sure expensive and time consuming calculations can be reused by others in an easy way.
