Learning resources
========================

Learning machine learning does not have to be expensive and very time consuming. Great learning material is published and the best is of course fully open (cc-by mostly). This so you can improve or build upon it if needed.

The selected learning resources in this section will give you a head start for playing with ML software. Of course all references open access resources (of course all are cc-by-sa licensed, unless indicated if not).
