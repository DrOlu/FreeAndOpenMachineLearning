ML Learning resources
========================

Learning machine learning does not have to be very expensive or time consuming. Great learning material for machine learning is licensed under a Creative Commons license. So in most cases also free available for anyone who is eager to learn this technology. 

In this section  an opinionated list of great machine learning resources is published for learning this technology. Of course only resources that are open, so only resources published using a Creative Commons license (cc-by mostly) or other real open license are included. So all references are open access resources.  


Most learning resource include hands-on tutorials. So be ready to use a notebook, but most tutorials offer notebooks ready to use directly.
