Free and Open Machine Learning 
================================

Abstract
---------

This book is focussed on applying machine learning solutions for real practical use cases. This means that the core focus in this book is outlining how to use open machine learning solutions in a simple way. This so you and everyone can benefit of this powerful technology in a simple way. 

Machine learning is an exciting and powerful technology. The continuous use and growth of machine learning technology opens new opportunities. It also enables solving complex problems in a simple way. Problems that were not simple to solve using traditional software technologies. This great machine learning technology should available to use for everyone. This means that everyone should be able to learn, play and create great applications using machine learning technology. Without borders or strings attached.

The key focus of this publication in on Free and Open Machine Learning technologies only. This to remove barriers for learning, playing and using machine learning technologies for real practical use cases for everyone. 

Of course you can use or switch to cloud company solutions to deploy your machine learning driven application in production. However besides vendor lock-in, crucial aspects like safety, privacy and security for machine learning applications can only be realized when using fully transparent Free and Open machine learning building blocks. 

This book describes an open machine learning architecture. Including all aspects involved for real business use. This means e.g. focus on FOSS machine learning software and open datasets. 

Since the majority of humans are not a graduated mathematician, we skip deep mathematical background concepts of machine learning algorithms in this publication. Good books with lots of mathematical background information on how machine learning works are available for more than 70 years. There are plenty excellent free and open publications available if you want to learn in depth the inner working of mathematical algorithms powering nowadays machine learning applications. In the learning resources section of this publication you can find a list of good references. All references are publications available under a creative commons license (cc-by).

This publication has a core focus on outlining how machine learning can be used for real business use cases. This is done by describing:

- Key machine learning concepts. The focus is on concepts that are needed in order to use solid FOSS machine learning frameworks and datasets when creating a machine learning powered application.

- An open reference architecture for creating and maintaining machine learning application and landscape.

- Most used Open Solution Building Blocks (FOSS based) which you can use to create your machine learning application as fast as possible. 

- Key quality aspects for engineering and maintaining your machine learning driven application.

- Important safety, privacy and security aspects to prevent disasters.

- Ethical issues (like bias) and how to handle this in a transparent way.

We avoid on purpose showing pieces of program code or mathematical formulas in this publications. No programming knowledge is needed to enjoy and learn machine learning.

This book is created to give you a head start to use and creating your open machine learning application to solve your business problems. Without any strings attached, so the focus is on using open transparent technologies only!
