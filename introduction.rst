Introduction
=============

With the use of Machine learning you can solve challenging problems that impact everyone around the world. Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are a rapidly emerging technologies that have the potential to change our world with speed that humankind has never experienced before. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are not the same, although the current technologies developed for ML do help research and developments on AI. ML can be characterized with a stricter definition from an engineering perspective. Trying to define AI raises more philosophical discussions on what intelligence is. This publication is focused on machine learning. But beware that the terms machine learning and artificial intelligence are are intertwined and many so called AI applications are in fact driven by machine learning technology.

However mind the buzz and fads surrounding AI and ML: Machine Learning, deep learning and a lot of tools developed are not â€œa universal solvent' for solving all problems on the road to perfect AI. No perfect or magic machine learning tool or method that can solve all your hard complex problems exist.Machine learning is just a solution for a certain type of problems currently. In future the use of machine learning tools and can be applied to a broader landscape of problems. But do not try to solve all your problems with one (new)technology. 

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are now in the forefront of global discourse, garnering increased
attention from practitioners, industry leaders, policymakers, and the general public.

What is covered in this book?
---------------------------------

Nowadays many people are talking about the transformative power of machine learning and how it will revolutionize the economy, but what does that mean for your business and how do you get started? How do get solid independent advice to learn how machine learning and can improve or disrupt your business? This book gives you a quick introduction to get started with machine learning. 

The field of machine learning and artificial intelligence is making rapid progress. Do you know what kind of applications for direct business use are already possible today? Are you aware of the very low entry barriers to take advantage of machine learning? Is your knowledge of free and open source solutions available in the machine learning eco system up to date? How do you classify safety, security and privacy risk when using machine learning? These and many other questions are the foundation of this book. 

With new machine learning applications and companies being created on a daily basis, it is difficult to get a hold of what applications are viable, and which are hype, fads or simple a hoax. Especially when the terms ML and AI are intertwined. This book directs you to tangible working open source machine learning software. This category machine learning software is used at large for real business use cases. And because it is OSS it can be studied and improved.

Given that machine learning tools and techniques are increasingly part of our everyday lives, it is critical for professionals in the IT industry to gain knowledge on machine learning and start asking questions yourself. What will you be doing with machine learning tools and applications the coming 3 years? Are you really aware of the safety and privacy concerns evolving that are part of this technology? Do you really understand and control the working?



This book is all about taking advantage of the new OSS machine learning technologies for your business. The major machine learning concepts are explained, but the main emphasis of this book is giving insights in the various possibilities that are available within the open source machine learning ecosystem. This so you can start applying machine learning in your business today, without unclear dependencies towards a vendor.

This book gives an overview of all important OSS machine learning frameworks and OSS machine learning support tools that you can use for prototyping or to use for real production systems.

This book will not explain and dive into statistics and basic math or the advanced mathematical algebra functions that form the foundation under machine learning algorithms. If you are interested in learning the mathematical foundations on which machine learning is developed you can find good starting material in the reference section of this book. 

This book aims to cover the high level machine learning concepts and gives you information to get started to work with machine learning for your business use case.

So this book is concentrated on machine learning aspects where software, business and technology touch each other.
