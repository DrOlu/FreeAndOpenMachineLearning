Natural Language Processing 
===========================

Introduction
-------------

A real tangible and still the most applied use case for machine learning is natural language processing (NLP). Many businesses use cases for machine learning are based information. This can be input or processed information. In fact most business use cases that can benefit of machine learning have nothing to do with images or video. Most business do have information of customers in digital form available and want to use this data to develop more value added services for their customers. 

Everything that has to do with text processing and involves machine learning can be categorized as Natural Language Processing (NLP).


NLP technology is important for scientific, economic, social, and cultural reasons. Computers that can communicate with humans as humans do are a holy grail. Including understanding context and emotions. Due to infinite number of cultures solving this problem has proven to be hard. Communication is not only verbal. Nonverbal is the significant part of communication. Nonverbal communication is the nonlinguistic transmission of information through visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic (physical) channels. 

NLP is experiencing rapid growth as its theories and methods are deployed in a variety of new machine learning technologies. 

More and more NLP techniques are used products that have serious impact on our daily lives. A misinterpreted pronounced word like ‘stop’ can have several meanings when used within an autonomous driving car. Maybe you just meant to warn your children instead of stopping the vehicle on a dangerous intersection. 

Creating good NLP based application using machine learning is hard. A simple test that gives an indication of the quality is to use a the sentence “Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo”. This sentence is correct. But many NLP algorithms and applications cannot handle this very well. Similar sentences exist in other languages. We humans are by nature good with complicated linguistic constructs, but many NLP algorithms still fail with this simple example. Some background information on this sentence can be found on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo )



Basic NLP functions
--------------------

NLP is able to do all kinds of basic text functions. A short overview:

* Text Classification
* Finding words with the same meaning for search.
* Understanding how much time does it take to read a text.
* Understanding how difficult it is to read is a text.
* Identifying the language of a text.
* Generating a summary of a text.
* Finding similar documents.
* Identifying entities (e.g., cities, people, locations) in a text.
* Translating a text.
* Text Generation.

Machine learning capabilities have proven to be very useful for improving typical NLP based use cases. This is due to the fact that text in digital format is widely available and machine learning algorithms typically perform good on large amounts of data.
