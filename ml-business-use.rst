Machine Learning for Business Problems
=======================================

Reading and talking about the in potential endless options for machine learning is nice and should be done. But applying machine learning for your business is where you can make a difference. This section is focussed on applying machine learning technology for real business use. Some business use cases where machine learning is already applied are outlined. This to give you some inspiration. But besides the technology more is needed for applying machine learning in a business with success. This section will also present some more in depth discussion of the several factors that should be taken into account when applying machine learning for real business use.

When to use machine learning for business problems?
-------------------------------------------------------

With the use of machine learning it is possible to learn from patterns and conditions to get new solid outcomes or predictions based on new data. Machine learning is able to learn from change patterns (data) at a pace that the human mind can not. This makes that machine learning is useful for a set of use cases were learning from data is possible or needed.
 

Machine learning should not be used for use cases that can be easily solved in another way. 
For example do not use machine learning driven solutions if your use case matches on of the following criteria:

* If it’s possible to structure a set of rules or “if-then scenarios” to handle your problem entirely, then there may be no need for machine learning at all.
* Your problem can be solved using statistical tools and software.

Common business use cases
-----------------------------

Healthcare
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Healthcare is due to the large amounts of data already available a perfect domain for solving challenges using machine learning. E.g. a challenging question for machine learning for healthcare is: Given the current use of machine learning for healthcare is given a patient’s electronic medical record data, can we prevent a person getting sick?

Machine learning is more and more used for automatic diagnostics. This can be data provided by X-ray scans or data retrieved from blood and tissue samples. machine learning has already proven to be valuable in detecting and predicting diseases for real people.

Predictive tasks for healthcare is maybe the way to keep people healthier and lower healthcare cost. The transformation from making people better towards preventing people getting sick will be long and hard, since this will be a real shift for the healthcare industry.

But given a large set of training data of de-identified medical records it is already possible to predict interesting aspects of the future for a patient that is not in training set.

Machine learning applications for healthcare are also to create better medicines by making use of all the data already available.

Language translation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Machine learning is already be used for automatic real-time message translation. E.g. Rocket Chat (The OSS Slack alternative, https://rocket.chat/ ) is using machine learning for this reason.
Since language translation needs context and lots of data, typically this use case is often NLP driven.
Language translation is as speech recognition a typical NLP application. Natural language processing (NLP) is area of machine learning that operates on (human)text and speech. See the section on NLP in this book for more use cases and insight in the specific NLP technologies.

Other areas for language translation are Speech recognition. Some great real time machine learning driven application already exist.

Chat bots
^^^^^^^^^^
 Currently all major tech companies like Amazon(Alexis), Google, Apple (Siri) have built a smart chatbot for the consumer market. Creating a chatbot (e.g. IRQ bot) was not new and difficult, however building a real ‘intelligent’ chat bot that has learning capabilities is another challenge. 
 
 Machine learning powered chatbots with real human like voices will help computers communicate with humans. But algorithms still have a hard time trying to figure out what you are saying, because context and tone of voice are hard to get right. Even for us humans, communication with other humans is most of the time hard. So building a smart chatbot that understands basic emotions in your voice is difficult. Machine learning isn’t advanced enough yet to carry on a dialogue without help, so a lot of the current chat bot software needs to be hand-coded.

eCommerce Recommendation systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A well known application for machine learning for eCommerce systems is a machine learning enabled recommendation system system. Whether you buy a book, trip, music or visit a movie: On all major online ecommerce site you get a recommendation for a product that seems to fit your interest perfectly. Of course the purpose is to drive up the online sale, but the algorithms used are examples of still evolving machine learning algorithms. 
Examples of these systems are:

* Selling tickets to concerts based on your profile.
* NetFlix or cinema systems to make sure you stay hooked on watching more series and films you like. 
* Finding similar products in an eCommerce environment with a great chance you buy it. E.g. similar hotels, movies, books, etc.



Quality inspection and improvement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When computer vision technologies are combined with machine learning capabilities new opportunities arise. Examples of real world applications are:

* Inspecting tomatoes (and other fruit / vegetables) for quality and diseases.
* Inspecting quality of automatic created constructions (e.a. Constructions made by robots)

Vision
^^^^^^^^^

Since vision is captured in data machine learning is a great tool for building applications using vision (images, movies) technology. E.g.:

* Face detection. Writing software to detect faces and do recognition is very very hard to do using traditional programming methods.
* Image classification. In the old days we were happy when software was able to distinguish a cat and dog. In 2018 far more advanced applications are possible. E.g. giving details on all kind of aspects of photos. E.g. when you organize a conference you can use software to check the amount of suits or hoodies visiting your conference. Which is of course great for marketing. 
* Image similarity. Given an image, the goal of an image similarity model is to find "similar" images. Just like in image classification, deep learning methods have been shown to give incredible results on this challenging problem. However, unlike in image similarity, there isn't a need to generate labelled images for model creation. This model is completely unsupervised.
* Object Detection. Object detection is the task of simultaneously classifying (what) and localizing (where) object instances in an image.


Risk and compliance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Evaluating risks can be done using large amounts of data. Natural language processing techniques can be used to validate highly automatic if your company meets regulations. Since audit and inspecting work is mostly based on standardized rules performed by knowledge workers this kind of work can be automated using machine learning techniques.

Example use cases 
---------------------

To outline some use cases that have been realized using machine learning technology, this paragraph summarize some real world cases to get some inspiration.

Applications for real business use of machine learning to solve real tangible problems is growing at a rapid pace. Below some examples of practical use of machine learning applications:

* Medical researchers are using ML techniques with TensorFlow to assess a person’s cardiovascular risk of a heart attack and stroke.
* Air Traffic Controllers are using TensorFlow to predict flight routes through crowded airspace for safe and efficient landings.
* Engineers are using TensorFlow to analyze auditory data in the rainforest to detect logging trucks and other illegal activities.
* Scientists in Africa are using TensorFlow to detect diseases in Cassava plants to improving yield for farmers.
* Finding free parking space. http://www.peazy.in has developed an app using machine learning to assist with finding a free parking space in crowded cities.
