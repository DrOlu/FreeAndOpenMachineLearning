**AllenNLP** 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**SBB Description:** An open-source NLP research library, built on PyTorch. AllenNLP is a NLP research library, built on PyTorch, for developing state-of-the-art deep learning models on a wide variety of linguistic tasks. AllenNLP makes it easy to design and evaluate new deep learning models for nearly any NLP problem, along with the infrastructure to easily run them in the cloud or on your laptop.

AllenNLP was designed with the following principles:

Hyper-modular and lightweight. Use the parts which you like seamlessly with PyTorch.
Extensively tested and easy to extend. Test coverage is above 90% and the example models provide a template for contributions.
Take padding and masking seriously, making it easy to implement correct models without the pain.
Experiment friendly. Run reproducible experiments from a json specification with comprehensive logging.

**Apache OpenNLP** 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**SBB Description:** The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text.
The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services. OpenNLP also included maximum entropy and perceptron based machine learning.
The goal of the OpenNLP project will be to create a mature toolkit for the abovementioned tasks. An additional goal is to provide a large number of pre-built models for a variety of languages, as well as the annotated text resources that those models are derived from.
