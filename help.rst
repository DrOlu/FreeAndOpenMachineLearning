We encourage all information professionals (developers, architects, consultants) to help to improve this Free and Open Machine Guide.


FOSS machine learning is essential for open innovation for the coming years.

This first publication explained why FOSS machine learning is needed and showed that you or your company can chose for the use of open machine learning. Even for real business use cases.

Using FOSS building blocks does not mean that you cannot benefit from the great advantages that some (Cloud)Companies offer. FOSS machine learning is an enabler for business innovation. So guard your freedom, but also take responsibility for the freedom of others that will benefit from your machine learning application(s).

In a next version of this publication your input is needed to improve the practical use of FOSS machine learning in practice. So if you:

- Like to share your real life experience with FOSS machine learning.
- Want to share your experience on using FOSS machine learning tools or ML building blocks.
- Like to share resources that should be mentioned in this FOSS machine learning publication.
- Discuss the content so it gets better. We do discussion on-line and off-line (meetups).
