Catalogue of Open ML Software
===============================


This section presents the most widespread, mature and promising open source ML software available. The purpose of this section is just to make you curious to maybe try something that suits you. 

ML software comes in many different forms. A lot can be written on the differences on all packages below, the quality or the usability. Truth is however there is never one best solution. Depending your practical use case you should make a motivated choice for what package to use. 

As with many other evolving technologies in heavy development: Standards are still lacking, so you must ensure that you can switch to another application with minimal pain involved. By using a real open source solution you already have taken the best step! Using OSS makes you far more independent than using ML cloud solutions. This because these work as ‘black-box’ solutions and by using OSS you can always build your own migration interfaces if needed. Lock-in for ML is primarily in the data and your data cleansing process. So always make sure that you keep full control of all your data and steps involved in the data preparation steps you follow. The true value for all ML solutions is of course always in the data. 

Open Machine Learning Frameworks
---------------------------------

There are a number of stable and production ready ML frameworks. But choosing which framework to use depends on the use case. If you want to experiment with the latest research insights implemented you will make another choice than if you need to implement your solution in production into a critical environment. For business use: So doing innovation experiments and creating machine learning application most of the time you want a framework that is stable and widely used. 

If you have an edge use case experimenting with different frameworks can be a valid choice.

PyTorch is dominating the research, but is now extending this success to industry applications. TensorFlow is already used for many production business cases. But as it is with all software: Transitions from major versions (from TensorFlow 1.0 to 2.0) is difficult. 
Interoperability standards to easily swith from ML framework are not mature for production use yet.
